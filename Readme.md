# SmartThings Actions

These are my custom SmartThings actions, stored here for informational purposes.

## Action List

Complete list of custom actions and their descriptions:

#### Pet Feeder Reminder (`pet-feeder-reminder.groovy`)
 
Allows you to specify a start and end time by which a contact sensor must be triggered. If the sensor is not triggered within the specified time each day, it is assumed that the pets were not fed at the appropriate time, and sends out text messages to one or two numbers reminding the "parents".
 
#### Coming ang Going (`coming-and-going.groovy`)
 
Allows you to receive a notification or text message whenever someone arrives or departs between a set time. For example, you can be alerted if your child arrives home after 11pm.
