## Action List

Complete list of custom actions and their descriptions:

 ### Pet Feeder Reminder (`pet-feeder-reminder.groovy`)
 
 Allows you to specify a start and end time by which a contact sensor must be triggered. If the sensor is not triggered within the specified time each day, it is assumed that the pets were not fed at the appropriate time, and sends out text messages to one or two numbers reminding the "parents".
